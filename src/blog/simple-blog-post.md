This is a sample blog post to demostrate how posts look with Native Elements. All the content of this article is inside a markdown file which is transformed by Eleventy into an HTML page.

```js
function myFunction() {
  // â€¦
  return true
}
```

How about a `<blockquote>`?

> Less is more.
> <cite>by Someone</cite>

A list of stuff:

- Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis
- Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur
- Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis

How about an ordered list of stuff:

1. Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis
2. Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur
3. Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis

Hopefully, this has demonstrated how simple it is to make a nice looking blog with Hylia.
